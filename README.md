# HapiJS Redis API

A mini todo app API done in HapiJS

## To install

Clone the repo and run `npm install` to download all the packages defined in the `package.json`.

## What its all about?

This is a simple example showing the power and simplicity of HapiJS. We have three endpoints. `todo_get`, `todo_post` and `todo_delete`.

Each of these are documented when you launch the app. `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

## Something to note

The database in use is Redis. You could change it up but that means your queries and operations might be slightly different. 

If you are using Redis as well, it would be awesome if you ran dockerized version of Redis. Simplifies the process incredibly.
